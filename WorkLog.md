# TODO

- Show last 3 burpees (to check i dont double or miss one)
- show average of last 7 days (to motivate to do more)
- Fix record section to have a parent flexbox and not be absolute fixed (landscape mode shows the issue)
- hide "record" when not logged in
- make app installable
- handle loading data and saving states
- Better way to show what i did in a day
- better way to compare expected and estimated finish date
